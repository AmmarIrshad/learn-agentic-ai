# [A2A Inspector](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-inspector)

The A2A Inspector is a web interface that allows you to interact with any A2A agent and inspect communication - you can see the on-the-wire JSON RPC messages going back and forth and ensure that your implementation adheres to the A2A specification. It provides a comprehensive suite of features to test and debug your A2A server, making development faster and more efficient.

You can use the A2A Inspector to:

- Connect to any A2A Agent: Easily connect to a local or remote A2A agent by specifying its base URL
- View agent card: Automatically fetch and display the agentâ€™s card, providing a quick overview of its capabilities.
- Perform specification compliance checks: The tool automatically performs basic validation on the agent card and messages to ensure they conform to the A2A specification.
- Live chat: A chat interface to send and receive messages with the connected agent, allowing for real-time interaction and testing.
- Inspect with clickable messages: Inspect the raw JSON being sent/received for each message by clicking on it .
- Debug console: A debug console at the bottom that can be toggled to inspect the raw HTTP requests and responses and to debug communication issues.
