## 🛡️ Advanced Security Patterns

### **mTLS Configuration for Agent Communication**

```python
import ssl
from pathlib import Path

# Configure mutual TLS for agent-to-agent communication
def create_secure_ssl_context(
    cert_file: Path,
    key_file: Path,
    ca_file: Path
) -> ssl.SSLContext:
    """Create SSL context with mutual TLS authentication"""
    context = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.Purpose.SERVER_AUTH)

    # Load client certificate for mutual authentication
    context.load_cert_chain(cert_file, key_file)

    # Load CA certificate for server verification
    context.load_verify_locations(ca_file)

    # Require mutual authentication
    context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED
    context.check_hostname = True

    return context

# Secure agent client with mTLS
@app.post("/secure/message/send")
async def secure_message_send(
    request: SecureMessageRequest,
    agent_context: AgentContext = Depends(verify_agent_identity)
):
    # Additional security: verify signed agent card
    await verify_signed_agent_card(request.agent_card_signature)

    # Send message with mTLS
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(
        verify=create_secure_ssl_context(
            cert_file="agent.crt",
            key_file="agent.key",
            ca_file="ca.crt"
        )
    ) as client:
        response = await client.post(
            f"https://{target_agent}/message/send",
            json=request.message,
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {agent_context.access_token}"}
        )

    return response.json()
```

### **Signed Agent Cards Implementation**

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes, serialization
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa, padding
import json
import base64

class SignedAgentCard:
    def __init__(self, private_key_path: Path):
        with open(private_key_path, 'rb') as f:
            self.private_key = serialization.load_pem_private_key(
                f.read(), password=None
            )

    def sign_agent_card(self, agent_card: dict) -> dict:
        """Sign agent card with RSA signature"""
        # Create canonical representation
        canonical_card = json.dumps(agent_card, sort_keys=True, separators=(',', ':'))

        # Generate signature
        signature = self.private_key.sign(
            canonical_card.encode('utf-8'),
            padding.PSS(
                mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
                salt_length=padding.PSS.MAX_LENGTH
            ),
            hashes.SHA256()
        )

        # Add signature to card
        signed_card = agent_card.copy()
        signed_card['signature'] = base64.b64encode(signature).decode('utf-8')
        signed_card['signature_algorithm'] = 'RS256-PSS'
        signed_card['signed_at'] = datetime.utcnow().isoformat()

        return signed_card

    @staticmethod
    def verify_agent_card(signed_card: dict, public_key_pem: str) -> bool:
        """Verify signed agent card"""
        # Extract signature
        signature_b64 = signed_card.pop('signature')
        signature_algorithm = signed_card.pop('signature_algorithm')
        signed_at = signed_card.pop('signed_at')

        # Verify signature age
        signature_time = datetime.fromisoformat(signed_at)
        if datetime.utcnow() - signature_time > timedelta(hours=24):
            raise SecurityError("Agent card signature expired")

        # Verify signature
        public_key = serialization.load_pem_public_key(public_key_pem.encode())
        canonical_card = json.dumps(signed_card, sort_keys=True, separators=(',', ':'))
        signature = base64.b64decode(signature_b64)

        try:
            public_key.verify(
                signature,
                canonical_card.encode('utf-8'),
                padding.PSS(
                    mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
                    salt_length=padding.PSS.MAX_LENGTH
                ),
                hashes.SHA256()
            )
            return True
        except Exception:
            return False
```

### **Replay Protection Implementation**

```python
import time
import hashlib
from typing import Set
import redis

class ReplayProtection:
    def __init__(self, redis_client: redis.Redis, window_seconds: int = 300):
        self.redis = redis_client
        self.window_seconds = window_seconds

    def generate_nonce(self) -> str:
        """Generate cryptographically secure nonce"""
        return secrets.token_urlsafe(32)

    def verify_request_timestamp(self, timestamp: int) -> bool:
        """Verify request timestamp within acceptable window"""
        current_time = int(time.time())
        time_diff = abs(current_time - timestamp)
        return time_diff <= self.window_seconds

    def check_replay_attack(self, request_id: str, timestamp: int, signature: str) -> bool:
        """Check for replay attack using Redis-based nonce tracking"""
        # Create unique request fingerprint
        request_fingerprint = hashlib.sha256(
            f"{request_id}:{timestamp}:{signature}".encode()
        ).hexdigest()

        # Check if request already processed
        if self.redis.get(f"request:{request_fingerprint}"):
            raise SecurityError("Replay attack detected")

        # Store request fingerprint with expiration
        self.redis.setex(
            f"request:{request_fingerprint}",
            self.window_seconds,
            "processed"
        )

        return True

# Middleware for replay protection
@app.middleware("http")
async def replay_protection_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    if request.method == "POST" and request.url.path.startswith("/agent/"):
        # Extract security headers
        timestamp = request.headers.get("X-Timestamp")
        nonce = request.headers.get("X-Nonce")
        signature = request.headers.get("X-Signature")

        if not all([timestamp, nonce, signature]):
            raise HTTPException(400, "Missing security headers")

        # Verify timestamp and replay protection
        replay_guard = ReplayProtection(redis_client)
        replay_guard.verify_request_timestamp(int(timestamp))
        replay_guard.check_replay_attack(nonce, int(timestamp), signature)

    return await call_next(request)
```

## 🎮 Security Testing Scenarios

```bash
# Generate certificates for mutual TLS
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout agent.key -out agent.crt -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=agent.example.com"

# Test mTLS communication
curl --cert agent.crt --key agent.key --cacert ca.crt \
  https://localhost:8443/.well-known/agent-card.json
```

### **Scenario 2: Signed Agent Card Verification**

```bash
# Get signed agent card

  python3 verify_agent_signature.py --public-key agent.pub
```

### **Scenario 3: Replay Attack Protection**

```bash
# Generate request with timestamp and nonce
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s)
NONCE=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
SIGNATURE=$(echo "${TIMESTAMP}${NONCE}" | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign agent.key | base64)

# Send secure request
curl -X POST https://localhost:8001/message/send \
  -H "X-Timestamp: $TIMESTAMP" \
  -H "X-Nonce: $NONCE" \
  -H "X-Signature: $SIGNATURE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "test"}'

# Replay same request (should fail)
curl -X POST https://localhost:8001/message/send \
  -H "X-Timestamp: $TIMESTAMP" \
  -H "X-Nonce: $NONCE" \
  -H "X-Signature: $SIGNATURE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "test"}'
