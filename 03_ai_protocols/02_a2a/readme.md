# Google Agent to Agent (A2A) Protocol - Agents Communicating with Agents

[Agent2Agent (A2A) Crash Course: Full Walkthrough With Real Multi-Agent Examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFkw3p5qSuA)

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol is new standard for enabling AI agents to communicate with each other regardless of the underlying framework they use. Whether your agents are built with OpenAI Agents SDK, ADK, CrewAI, LangGraph, or any other framework, A2A provides a standardized communication layer. This will increase autonomy and multiply productivity gains, while lowering long-term costs.

> [Google Cloud has donated A2A to the Linux Foundation](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-cloud-donates-a2a-to-linux-foundation/)! A2A is now an open, vendor-neutral standard backed by Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow etc.

## Why A2A Protocol?

### The Problem Without A2A

Imagine you have a personal assistant agent that needs to:

- Book a hotel through a hotel booking agent
- Rent a car through a car rental agent
- Get weather information from a weather agent

Without A2A, for each agent you want to communicate with, you need to:

- Figure out what the agent can do
- Understand what format of information to send (audio, text, JSON?)
- Learn what kind of response to expect
- Build custom tools and wrappers for each agent

This creates redundant work and complexity as you scale to more agents.

### The Solution With A2A

A2A standardizes agent communication by providing:

- Uniform discovery: Standard way to find out what agents can do
- Consistent messaging: Standardized message format across all agents
- Framework agnostic: Works with any AI framework underneath
- Scalable architecture: Easy to add new agents without custom integration

## 1. What Value is A2A Providing?

- Interoperability & opacity ‚Äì Agents running on different stacks can cooperate without leaking internal prompts, weights, or tool code.

- Async-first design ‚Äì Long tasks, human-in-the-loop approvals, and incremental artefact uploads are first-class citizens.

- Enterprise readiness ‚Äì Spec includes TLS, mTLS, OAuth 2 / JWT, push-notification hardening, and error codes.

- Analysts see A2A (alongside MCP) as a key building block for future multi-agent ecosystems.

## üìê Design Principles

Here‚Äôs a polished and integrated **Design Principles** section for your A2A learning guide, drawing directly from official sources:

### 1. **Embrace agentic capabilities**

A2A empowers agents to collaborate in their native, unstructured modalities‚Äîwhether reasoning, synthesizing, or conversing‚Äî**without sharing memory, tools, or internal context**. This enables true multi-agent workflows rather than reducing each agent to a single-function ‚Äútool‚Äù.

---

### 2. **Build on existing standards**

Instead of reinventing the wheel, A2A builds on proven open standards‚Äî**HTTP(S)** for transport, **JSON‚ÄëRPC 2.0** for structured messaging, and **Server‚ÄëSent Events (SSE)** for real-time streaming. This makes integration with existing IT systems smoother and more maintainable.

---

### 3. **Secure by default**

Security is foundational in A2A. The protocol includes **enterprise-grade authentication and authorization**, aligning with OpenAPI security schemes (e.g., OAuth2, bearer tokens, JWT). This ensures agents interact over **encrypted, trusted channels** right out of the gate.

---

### 4. **Support for long-running tasks**

Agent-enabled tasks often span large timeframes‚Äîfrom seconds to hours or even days. A2A is built to support this with real-time insights into task state (‚Äúworking‚Äù, ‚Äúinput‚Äërequired‚Äù, ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù), **streaming updates**, and notifications meant for human-in‚Äëthe‚Äëloop workflows.

---

### 5. **Modality agnostic**

The protocol doesn‚Äôt limit agents to plain text. Whether it‚Äôs **audio, video, images, structured data, or interactive UI components**, A2A supports rich and evolving communication forms, enabling truly versatile multi-agent systems.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Agent Discovery

Agents find each other using **Agent Cards**, JSON files hosted at a well-known URI (e.g., `/.well-known/agent-card.json`). These cards detail an agent‚Äôs capabilities and how to connect.

#### 1. Agent Cards

Think of agent cards as business cards for AI agents. Each agent publishes a card that includes:

- Name: The agent's identifier
- Description: High-level overview of what the agent does
- URL: Where the agent is hosted
- Input/Output modes: Supported data types (text, audio, etc.)
- Skills: Specific capabilities the agent offers
- Example queries: Sample requests the agent can handle

Example agent card structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Hotel Booking Agent",
  "description": "Personal concierge for booking and managing hotel reservations",
  "url": "localhost:1003",
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "book_room",
      "description": "Book a hotel room for specified dates"
    },
    {
      "name": "check_availability",
      "description": "Check room availability for given dates"
    }
  ],
  "examples": [
    "Book a room for this weekend",
    "Are there any king suites available?"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Message and Tasks

A2A uses two main communication types:

1. Messages: For quick, immediate responses. Messages contain:
   - Role: Who sent it (user, agent, etc.)
   - Parts: The actual content (text, audio, etc.)
   - Metadata: Message ID, task ID, context ID for state management

Tasks: For long-running operations that take time to complete. Tasks include: - Artifacts: Where the agent stores its work output - Status: Current state (submitted, in-progress, completed, failed)

- Updates: Real-time status changes

Tasks are created to handle requests, with states like `working`, `completed`, or `input-required`. Clients can poll task status or receive updates via streaming or notifications.

Artifacts Outputs (file, text, data) streamed or returned when complete

### 3. Agent Executor

A wrapper class that standardizes how agents receive and process requests. Every A2A-compliant agent must implement:

- execute(): Processes incoming requests
- cancel(): Handles cancellation requests

The agent executor bridges the gap between A2A's standard interface and your specific agent framework.

## Understanding A2A Fundamentals

### Basic Workflow

1. Discovery: Client agent fetches agent cards from remote agents
2. Selection: Based on capabilities, client chooses appropriate agent
3. Communication: Client sends standardized messages via HTTP/HTTPS
4. Processing: Remote agent processes request through agent executor
5. Response: Remote agent returns standardized message or task

### Communication Flow Example

Personal Agent ‚Üí Hotel Agent

1. GET /well-known/agents.json (fetch agent card)
2. POST /messages (send booking request)
3. Response: Message with booking confirmation

The A2A protocol represents an important step toward more collaborative and interoperable AI agent ecosystems, enabling developers to focus on building great agents rather than worrying about integration complexity.

## üõ†Ô∏è How A2A Works

A2A enables seamless, secure collaboration between a **Client Agent** (who initiates tasks) and a **Remote Agent** (who executes them). The interaction proceeds through four key capabilities:

### 1. Capability Discovery

Each remote agent exposes an **Agent Card**‚Äîa JSON file (typically at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`) that declares its skills, supported input/output types, UI modalities, and authentication methods. Client agents fetch these cards to find the right specialist agent for a task.

---

### 2. Task Management

Tasks are stateful units of work with a clear lifecycle: `submitted` ‚Üí `working` ‚Üí (`input‚Äërequired`) ‚Üí `completed`/`failed`/`canceled`.
Client agents create tasks and monitor progress, while remote agents process them, update status, and eventually produce **artifacts**‚Äîthe finalized outputs (text, files, media, structured data).

---

### 3. Collaboration and Messaging

Agents exchange structured **messages** via JSON-RPC over HTTP. Messages include multiple **parts**, where each part contains a complete piece of content (e.g., text snippet, image, or widget). This lets agents ask clarifying questions, share context, or pass intermediate results.

---

### 4. User-Experience Negotiation

Each message part indicates its content type and optional UI hints. This allows agents to adapt outputs to client-side interfaces‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs rendering an iframe, playing a video, showing a form, or simply streaming text. This negotiation ensures outputs are displayed well in the end-user UI.

---

### üîÑ Typical Interaction Flow

| Step                        | Description                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Discovery                | Client fetches the Agent Card to learn capabilities and connection details.                    |
| 2. Initiation               | Client sends a task via `message/send` or starts streaming with `message/stream`.              |
| 3. Execution                | Remote agent updates task state, streaming progress via SSE or pushing via webhooks.           |
| 4. Collaboration (Optional) | If input is needed, remote agent flags `input-required`, prompting additional messages.        |
| 5. Completion               | Task transitions to final state; client retrieves artifacts via `tasks/get` or streaming ends. |

## How A2A differs from MCP (one-liner)

MCP is **agent ‚Üî context**; A2A is **agent ‚Üî agent**. Both reuse JSON-RPC over HTTP and SSE, but A2A layers discovery (Agent Card), task lifecycle, and push-notification workflows specialised for peer-to-peer collaboration.

## If use the agent to agent protocol to wrap a ai agent, is it stateful as per the a2a protocl?

In the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol**, whether the wrapped AI agent is _stateful_ depends on how the underlying agent is implemented, not just on the protocol itself.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

- **The A2A protocol core itself is stateless by design.**
  It‚Äôs essentially a standardized message-passing interface ‚Äî think of it like HTTP for agents. Each request from one agent to another is self-contained, carrying all the context needed for the receiving agent to respond. The protocol doesn‚Äôt require the receiver to remember anything from past interactions, and any ‚Äústate‚Äù identifiers (`taskId`, `contextId`, etc.) are just metadata ‚Äî the protocol doesn‚Äôt persist them automatically.

- **Statefulness comes from the agent implementation, task store or memory layer.**
  When wrapped AI agent keeps its own memory (session variables, conversation history, knowledge store, etc.) and uses some form of session ID or conversation context to retrieve that making wrapped agent will behave _statefully_ across A2A calls.

  Additionally if the runtime hosting your agent uses a **TaskStore** (in-memory or persistent) or other memory backend, it can link multiple messages together into a single _ongoing_ task. This is what enables **multi-turn conversations** and intermediate states like `"input-required"`.

  If it doesn‚Äôt keep memory, then each A2A call will be _stateless_, even if the protocol is the same.

- **Statefulness comes from the agent‚Äôs task store or memory layer.**
  If the runtime hosting your agent uses a **TaskStore** (in-memory or persistent) or other memory backend, it can link multiple messages together into a single _ongoing_ task. This is what enables **multi-turn conversations** and intermediate states like `"input-required"`.
  Without such a store, each A2A call is processed independently ‚Äî even if it carries a `taskId`.

- **Typical patterns:**

  1. **Stateless** ‚Äî Every request contains the full context (prompt + data) needed for the agent to respond. No `taskId` or history retrieval is involved.
  2. **Stateful** ‚Äî The request includes a `taskId` and/or `contextId` that the agent runtime uses to fetch stored conversation state or task progress from a backend store.

**Bottom line:**

A2A ‚â† stateful by default ‚Äî but it is **state-friendly by design**. You _can_ make it stateful by designing your agent to persist and retrieve context between calls.

Its message format includes IDs and metadata so that implementations _can_ maintain state if they choose. The LangGraph examples show this in action: they store state in a `TaskStore` and resume work when the same IDs come back in later calls.

Think of A2A like a phone line: it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúremember‚Äù your last conversation, but you can still call the same person who keeps a diary of what you talked about. üìíüìû Recipient _can_ look up past notes if they want.

### Example

Here‚Äôs a **side-by-side diagram** showing how **pure A2A (stateless)** differs from **A2A + TaskStore (stateful)**, based the official A2A LangGraph example.
